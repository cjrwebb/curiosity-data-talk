# Why does everyone need access to&lt;br&gt;data storytelling?

- Stories that include a data narrative are **powerful rhetorical tools**.

- There is **inequitable access** to data and the skills required to turn raw data into visualisations, models, and interfaces that tell data stories.

- This means that many data stories go unheard or, at best, are **filtered through another actor** (e.g. a research institute, news provider). This kind of exclusion is usually associated with other kinds of exclusion.

- 'One dataset, many analysts': it's **good for science and society** (Silberzahn, et al. 2018)


???

Stories that include a data narrative are powerful rhetorical tools, by which I mean they are very good for convincing people of what the writer wants to convince them of, because the numbers in the story often make the story sound much more legitimate - even if the numbers and their interpretations are wrong. In fact, it's quite common for people to dismiss any truth in a story because it's not 'backed up by numbers.' In a fight between a 'data story' and any other kind of story, the data story usually wins.

# Democratising data storytelling:&lt;br&gt;Availability

The first, and most basic step of democratising access to data and the ability to tell stories with data is availability. In some ways, there is a lot of progress being made on this. 

&gt; ### &lt;span style="color:black"&gt;No one can tell stories with data if they can't get their hands on the data.&lt;/span&gt; 

However, despite growing availability of data and resources to learn basic and even advanced data science, translating that data into a story can be a daunting and time consuming task - especially for someone who is trying to tell a story, not make data science their full time job!

# Democratising data storytelling:&lt;br&gt;Participation

.pull-left[
&lt;font size = 4&gt;Social research that made use of data science is actually one of the earliest progenitors of &lt;b&gt;participatory action research&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size = 4&gt;W.E.B. Du Bois created data visualisations that showed the growing prosperity and strengths of the African American community at the 1900 Paris exhibition by working together with members of his community to pursue the kinds of research and data representations they wanted and felt was important. This was in opposition to the racist deficit-focused narratives they faced (Battle-Baptiste, et al. 2018).&lt;/font&gt;

# Democratising data storytelling:&lt;br&gt; Accessibility

Just because something is **available**, or that people have been invited to **participate**, doesn't mean that what is produced is **accessible**. But what does accessible mean in this context?

--

&gt; Accessibility and full participation is being involved in every step, as far as possible. In data storytelling it means not just availability of data or participation in the creation of a data story. **It's about being able to ask and answer the questions that matter to you**.

--

**A social model of data storytelling?** What are the barriers stopping people from being able to create their own data stories and what tools do we have at our disposal to make data storytelling accessible.
